If you don't pass an element,\n`mouse` will watch the entire browser window.\n\n`listener` will attach the listener event to another element – helpful, for\nexample, to catch movement across a larger area but still receive positions\nrelative to `element`.\n\n### mouse.x\n\nThe current horizontal position of the mouse, in pixels.\n\n### mouse.y\n\nThe current vertical position of the mouse, in pixels.\n\n### mouse.prevX\n\nThe previous horizontal position of the mouse, in pixels.\n\n### mouse.prevY\n\nThe previous vertical position of the mouse, in pixels.\n\n### mouse.on('move', callback(event))\n\nCalled every time the mouse is moved anywhere on the targeted element.\n\n### mouse.flush()\n\nCall this method at the end of each frame to update the `prevX` and `prevY`\nvalues – you won't get `mousemove` events every frame, so if you don't update\nthis you might get incorrect values.\n\n## License\n\nMIT.
